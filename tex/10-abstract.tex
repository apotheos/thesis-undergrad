Creating the index for a book can be one of two things for an author: arduous, or expensive.
If an automated process can be introduced which effectively generates an index with approximately the same accurracy as a human, it would reduce the time and money authors need to spend on their work, allowing them to allocate those resources in a more useful way.
This preliminary research looks to establish the efficiacy of using a Na{\"i}ve Bayes' classifier trained with data extracted from Wikipedia articles to create an index for a Biology textbook.
The preliminary results suggest that this study's approach is not effective in creating an accurate and effective index.
However the research and results can be used to inform and refine future attempts to automate the indexing process.
